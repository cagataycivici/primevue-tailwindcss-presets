# primevue-tailwindcss-presets

PrimeVue Tailwind CSS presets is an add-on to styled the entire UI suite with Tailwind CSS through Pass Through attributes. Due to the significant maintenance costs of developing the default styled mode and pass through Tailwind Presets at the same time, PrimeTek is looking for active community members to take ownership of the project. If interested, please fork the project and contact us by creating an issue ticket.

Note that this only applies to the pass through version, the Tailwind version [based on @apply](https://tailwind.primevue.org) is actively maintained by PrimeTek.
